In his journey of memories, Andy describes the meeting with the drummer Stewart Copeland and the vocalist Sting, the difficult climb to success, the apotheosis of world tours, the arguments and bickering unsustainable between them so much that they force them to take a break lasting 27 years until the announcement, in 2007, of their last tour as a band.","The greatness of the Police does not lie in the pieces, in the success, in the myth, but in the number. Three. Perfection. Bass guitar drums. Rock doesn't need anything else. Images of the past, when the first guitarist Henry Padovani was still in Andy's place. Pure punk.
