Now Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, sits on the throne next to Claudius, her husband's murderer, and the young prince ponders revenge; to fulfill his plan he does not hesitate to sacrifice the love that the young Ophelia feels for him. The prince pretends to be mad and the young woman suffers from it until she dies. Meanwhile, the tragedy looms over the throne of the usurpers and is unleashed when wandering actors arrive at the palace: Hamlet makes them stage a drama that traces his family history. Revenge will be inexorable, like a storm, and will lead everyone to the grave, including the avenger. Franco Zeffirelli signs, with this umpteenth version of Shakespearean Hamlet, a work of vast spectacle, relying on proven actors such as the English Alan Bates and the American Glenn Close, in the roles of the reigning usurpers and choosing for the part of the protagonist the Australian Mel Gibson, used to playing adventurous characters.\",\n",

One is a journalist, the other is in a maximum security prison because he is a terrorist. The respective choices have distant roots and mix private issues (the relationship with the family and the severe father, a Protestant pastor) and public (Germany's Nazi past). At the news of her sister's suicide in prison, the reporter is not satisfied with the official version, but the evidence of the political murder no longer interests a distracted public opinion eager only to forget. In an admirable balance of feelings and despair, Von Trotta develops an emblematic story which, in the moment in which she resumes the news (the death in prison of the terrorist Gudrun Esslin), manages to sublimate it in a reflection that touches universal chords. The performers are of rare effectiveness, with the two protagonists above all. It is no coincidence that the title of this film has become a commonly used expression. Golden Lion in Venice.\",\n",

The situation is confused everywhere and bands of rioters are rampant in various provinces. The American proposes his deal to the prime minister, but the latter refuses. The centers of power and the army are thus left unguarded when the rebels attack. Rather boring and conventional, it does not deviate from the canons of the adventurous-exotic genre very popular at that time in Hollywood. The only exception from the general flatness is the interpretation of Deborah Kerr in the role of the blind daughter of a missionary.\",\n",

Theirs is a tumultuous bond and the situation worsens when David, who has since been drinking, is reprimanded in his environment because Ruth does not belong to his world. It will end in tragedy. The film tells the true story of the last woman sentenced to death in Great Britain, whose execution sparked a harsh campaign in public opinion, which would have led to the abolition of the death penalty. Newell sensitively stages an image of 1950s England gray, dirty, desperate. In this universe, completely closed in on itself, a passion develops between two beings, which everything seems to separate, destined to clash with the hypocrisy of common morality. Because of her social position, Ruth is defeated from the start; her desperate gesture is a cry of protest, to which the system responds by condemning her definitively.',\n",

Burnie gradually discovers the truth: Bix hasn't been able to play for a long time because he was made ugly by alcohol, and he had no one next to him to comfort him. Lisa herself was a stranger: Bix had limited himself to buying a picture of her in a photo shop and mailing it to her mother.

       "  'On Christmas Eve in Milan, a young industrialist returns to his nice apartment in the center where his girlfriend is waiting for him. Man is obsessed with a thought: how far can you blow into a balloon without breaking it? After numerous tests and after having asked for help without results even from an engineer friend, our hero also quarrels with his girlfriend. Left alone at home with his dog, he sits down at the table. One last attempt: at the umpteenth explosion he takes a run and throws himself out the window. An absolutely brilliant Ferreri invents this very acidic metaphor on alienation, supported by a great Mastroianni and a spicy Spaak.',\n",

One of these tries to kill him, then kidnaps his little brother to blackmail him. But Tonino kills him in a rustic duel. Then he hands himself over to the police to prevent his little brother from believing him a hero and following him on the road to crime.

They will come out, in pieces, after causing the clash between the other two as well. But somehow hatred will make them even more accomplices and neighbors. Mike Nichols' first film. The theatrical origin (the film is based on a successful work by Edward Albee) is not hidden, but rather underlined by the claustrophobic setting and by the unity of time (one night only) in which the story takes place, classically. Nichols himself, moreover, came directly from theatrical direction. Of course, Burton and Taylor are the star performers, even too much. Three Oscars: Liz Taylor (protagonist), Sandy Dennis (supporting), Haskell Wexler (photography).\",\n",
